# landing-page

This will be my solution to the landing page project for the Odin Project.
I want to demonstrate to myself what I have learnt so far with HTML and CSS. Also I would like to have a similar design to what the project requirements are while also showing some of my personality as well. 

The photos on the site not mine, they are all stock photos that are free to use. The details can be found in the links below
